# SpaceXTest

A simple demo of an IOS app to read spaceX data and display it in a master details layout.
It was written in swift using SwiftUI. Databinding was implemented through a MVVM pattern.
There was not much time spent on any interface elements as there was some time pressure to complete the demo.
A POD was used for the service (why reinvent the wheel).

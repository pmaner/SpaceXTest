# SpaceXTest

A simple demo of an IOS app to read spaceX data and display it in a master details layout.
 - It was written in swift.
 - Interface was developed in SwiftUI
 - Databinding was implemented through a MVVM pattern.
 - Interface uses view composition 
 - A POD was used for the service (why reinvent the wheel).
 
There was not much time spent on any interface elements as there was some time pressure to complete the demo after working a full time position.
